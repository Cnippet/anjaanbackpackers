Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Kedarnath temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and a Dham among the Chardhaams, standing at an altitude of 3580 m above sea level. Pandavaas established Kedarnath temple in the 8th century at the banks of the Mandakini River, which gives a magnificent view of the valley and mountains to the Shiva devotees. Kedarnath temple has a separate place in the hearts of people who are adventure enthusiasts and are also devoted to Lord Shiva, which makes it one of the most visited pilgrimages in India.
